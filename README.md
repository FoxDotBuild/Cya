Choose Your own Adventure Robot (Cya) - all the files and documentation needed to build Cya and choose your adventure!

This repository contains all the source code for Cya, the Choose Your own Adventure robot that is detailed on Hackaday: https://hackaday.io/project/181010-choose-your-own-adventure-bot

Cya can run using either python code or C++ Arduino style code, so there are separate directories for each.
