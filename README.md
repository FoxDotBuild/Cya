There are many different aspects to robotics and Cya lets you explore the ones you find most interesting. You can explore electronics, mechanical design, programming, CAD design, sensors, 3D printing, and even create your own anthropomorphic behaviors with Cya. Cya was originally created as part of a Hackaday competition; additional info can be found [here](https://hackaday.io/project/181010-choose-your-own-adventure-bot).

Choose Your own Adventure Robot (Cya) - all the files and documentation needed to build Cya and choose your own adventure!

This repository contains all the source code for Cya, the Choose Your own Adventure robot that is detailed on Hackaday: https://hackaday.io/project/181010-choose-your-own-adventure-bot

Cya can run using either python code or C++ Arduino style code, so there are separate directories for each.
