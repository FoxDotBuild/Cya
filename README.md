There are many different aspects to robotics and Cya lets you explore the ones you find most interesting. You can explore electronics, mechanical design, programming, CAD design, sensors, 3D printing, create your own anthropomorphic behaviors, or just have fun building Cya. Cya was originally created as part of a Hackaday competition; additional info can be found [here](https://hackaday.io/project/181010-choose-your-own-adventure-bot).

## Electronics
There are three circuit boards in the basic Cya, the head, the hip, and the Femur-Tibula. The schematics and circuit board designs for each of these are in the Electronics folder. This allows you to examine the schematics, modify them to create your own custom version of Cya or to learn how to do electronics CAD, and even create your own circuit boards.

### Head Circuit Board
The head is designed in KiCad, a free and open source circuit board design tool.

### Hip Circuit Board

### Femur-Tibula Circuit BOard


Cya can run using either python code or C++ Arduino style code, so there are separate directories for each.
